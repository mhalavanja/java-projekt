# Java Swing Project
Simple Java Swing project for visualizing different search algorithms on a 2D grid. 
Some functionalities include:
- Choosing the start and the finish squares
- Drawing walls with mouse before or during a search
- Choosing one of implemented search algorithms:
    * A*
    * BFS
    * DFS
    * Dijkstra
    * Greedy Search
- Saving the state of grid (start, finish, walls) to SQLite database
- Opening and using already saved grids.
Tests include some automatic graphical tests making sure all the basic components are present on the screen and some basic functionalities are working.
